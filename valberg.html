							<h4>Valberg's Mechanica is a novel I am currently writing as part of a larger worldbuilding project. Please enjoy the following short excerpt:</h4>
							<center><h2>Memento Mori</h2></center>
							<p>The metal walkway beneath Anya’s boots creaked and groaned as she strode in earnest toward the rusted bulkhead. Her eyes darted back and forth between sentry stations, spotlights glaring down on the path ahead. Taking care to avoid detection, she drew out Scathi, her amethyst eyes narrowing in the reflection along its polished obsidian blade as swirls of smoke began to emanate from the blade, enveloping the hilt. Hardening her gaze to focus, she threw the blade outwards and summoned wisps of darkness around her as she dissipated into the shadows, following the path of the smoke in Scathi’s wake before rematerializing by it to get a better view of the road before her.</p>
							<p><i>Spotlights trailing along the path ahead…for such a seemingly abandoned location it is weirdly well-guarded. What exactly is Emera trying to contain here?</i></p>
							<p>Anya’s musings were interrupted by the hiss of pistons as the bulkhead creaked open, revealing a ragged figure on the other side. He was gaunt, with a wild look in his eyes as he began to dash straight down the center path into the light, each stride uneven and erratic as he exclaimed, “They couldn’t catch me they couldn’t catch me they couldn’t catch me!” His head then snapped upwards, towards the perch Anya was sitting on, “FREEDOM! FREEDOM BELONGS TO ME!”</p>
							<p>A sudden shrill screech pierced the air followed immediately by a gurgling sound as a harpoon impaled the man where he stood. The chain attached to the end was pulled taut as the sentries began reeling in their prey. Anya’s eyes trailed up towards the void where the harpoon dragged the mangled body, his face petrified in a manic grin as blood ran down his lips. Her eyes widened as she met the fleshless grins of past victims hanging above, their defiance long since punished.</p>
							<p><i>Who…was that? And why are they taking such extreme measures to guard this place?</i></p>
							<p>Anya’s head whipped around as a clink echoed to her left, her gaze focusing on the glint of a badge that had fallen from where the man had been taken. She picked up the item, its ornate surface adorned with a silver wolf whose neck morphed into the blade of a dagger. The insignia of the Eisenacht Order. <i>So that’s where all of our agents have been going…fuck me that explains a lot.</i></p>
							<p>She turned her focus back towards her destination, coming to the realization that Scathi’s smoke trail would be far too conspicuous. Cursing under her breath, Anya stopped to take a closer look at the path each of the spotlights was traveling, hoping to find a point where a pathway can open up. She wiped the fog from the face of her watch, her heart racing as she waited for the opportunity to move. A shiver ran through her as her breath condensed into a fine plume in front of her.</p>
							<p><i>Tick…tick…tick.</i></p>
							<p>With mere seconds to spare before her window, Anya closed her eyes in careful concentration, once again allowing the wisps of darkness to enshroud her frame. The landscape around her shifted into an infinite black sea whose waters ran up to her knees. Along the surface, she could see the material world reflected around her, a bizarre imitation that swirled and distorted with each disturbance to the surface. Anya trudged through the water, each step more difficult to wade through than the last as she began to see spots in her vision, reserves draining as she struggled to maintain her incorporeal state. A hand from beneath her grabbed at her heel, dragging her further down so that the water was at her hip, much to her consternation. Anya’s strides became smaller and more labored, her vision darkening further…</p>
							<p>and further…</p>
							<br>
							<p>and further…</p>
