							<h1>Valberg's Mechanica</h1>

							<p>Valberg's Mechanica is a novel I am currently writing as part of a larger worldbuilding project. Please enjoy the following short excerpt:</p>
							<p>The metal walkway beneath Anya’s boots creaked and groaned as she strode in earnest toward the rusted bulkhead. Her eyes darted back and forth between sentry stations, spotlights glaring down on the path ahead. Taking care to avoid detection, she drew out Scathi, her amethyst eyes narrowing in the reflection along its polished obsidian blade as swirls of smoke began to emanate from the blade, enveloping the hilt. Hardening her gaze to focus, she threw the blade outwards and summoned wisps of darkness around her as she dissipated into the shadows, following the path of the smoke in Scathi’s wake before rematerializing by it to get a better view of the road before her.</p>
							<p><i>Spotlights trailing along the path ahead…for such a seemingly abandoned location it is weirdly well-guarded. What exactly is Emera trying to contain here?</i></p>
							<p>Anya’s musings were interrupted by the hiss of pistons as the bulkhead creaked open, revealing a ragged figure on the other side. He was gaunt, with a wild look in his eyes as he began to dash straight down the center path into the light, each stride uneven and erratic as he exclaimed, “They couldn’t catch me they couldn’t catch me they couldn’t catch me!” His head then snapped upwards, towards the perch Anya was sitting on, “FREEDOM! FREEDOM BELONGS TO ME!”</p>
							<p>A sudden shrill screech pierced the air followed immediately by a gurgling sound as a harpoon impaled the man where he stood. The chain attached to the end was pulled taut as the sentries began reeling in their prey. Anya’s eyes trailed up towards the void where the harpoon dragged the mangled body, his face petrified in a manic grin as blood ran down his lips. Her eyes widened as she met the fleshless grins of past victims hanging above, their defiance long since punished.</p>
